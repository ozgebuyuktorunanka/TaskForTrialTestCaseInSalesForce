## How to Install Dependencies from a `requirements.txt` File

1. **Python Installation**: Firstly, ensure that Python is installed on your computer. If Python is not installed, you can download the latest version from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it.

2. **Selenium WebDriver:** 
 You need to install a Selenium-supported browser driver. Your code seems to be written for the Firefox browser, so you may need to install GeckoDriver (the driver for Firefox). Download and install this driver on your computer. Download and installation instructions can be found on the official GitHub page for Geckodriver.

3. **Selenium Library:**
 You need to install the Selenium library for Python. You can do this with the following command:
 
 ```python
pip install selenium
```

4. **WebDriverManager:**
 You may need to install the WebDriverManager library to manage browser drivers. This library automatically downloads and configures browser drivers. You can install it with the following command: 

 ```python
pip install webdriver-manager
```

5. **Obtain the `requirements.txt` File**: You need to download the `requirements.txt` file and save it to your computer. This file contains a sequential list of the dependencies mentioned in the list.

6. **Open a Command Prompt or Terminal**: Open a command prompt or terminal on your computer.

7. **Install Dependencies**: Use the following command to install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> Running this command will download and install each dependency mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file. 

8.  **Verify Installed Dependencies**: To ensure that the dependencies were installed correctly, you can list the installed packages and their version numbers using the following command:

```python
pip list
```
> This command will list the packages that are currently installed on your system
By following these steps, you can successfully install the specified dependencies on a different computer. This makes it easy to share the development or execution environment of your project with others.
 
 

>Notes: Once you've completed these steps, your Selenium test scenario should work seamlessly on your computer. If you are using a specific driver (e.g., Firefox), make sure to install the correct version of that driver and set it up. After completing the installations, you can run your scenario by executing your Python script.
